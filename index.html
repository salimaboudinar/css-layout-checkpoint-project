      <p class="huh"><b>.The horse is one of two extant subspecies of Equus
          ferus. It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic
          family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million
          years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large,
          single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses around
          4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread
          by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated,
          although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral
          horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term
          is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as
          the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only
          remaining true wild horse. There is an extensive, specialized
          vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering
          everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings,
          breeds, locomotion, and behavior.</b></p>

          environment, the modern domestic horse has a life expectancy of 25 to
          30 years.[7] Uncommonly, a few animals live into their 40s and,
          occasionally, beyond.[8] The oldest verifiable record was "Old Billy",
          a 19th-century horse that lived to the age of 62.[7] In modern times,
          Sugar Puff, who had been listed in Guinness World Records as the
          world's oldest living pony, died in 2007 at age 56.[9] Regardless of a
          horse or pony's actual birth date, for most competition purposes a
          year is added to its age each January 1 of each year in the Northern
          Hemisphere[7][10] and each August 1 in the Southern Hemisphere.[11]
          The exception is in endurance riding, where the minimum age to compete
          is based on the animal's actual calendar age.[12] The following
          terminology is used to describe horses of various ages.</b></p>

          months of age, although foals can be weaned at four months with no
          adverse physical effects.[14] Yearling: A horse of either sex that is

          <td style="width: 361.667px;">The Arabian horse traditionally lives in
            a harsh desert climate which makes it appreciated by nomadic Bedouin
            peoples, going so far as to share their family's tent with it. This
            close relationship has forged a good-natured, intelligent and always
            ready to learn breed who have developed great endurance and
            exceptional resistance to prolonged exertion from their use in war.

          <td style="width: 344px;">The Thoroughbred (English: Thoroughbred,
            official abbreviation PS), is the best known of the warm-blooded
            horse breeds. It is one of the most common breeds, since it runs on
            racetracks during gallop races. The name "thoroughbred" can in
            theory refer to several breeds of horses, and by extension, animal
            breeds. The name "thoroughbred English", aged, is seen as a pleonasm
            in the eyes of purists. </td>
          <td style="width: 306.1px;">The Appaloosa is a breed of saddle horse
            native to the Northwestern United States. From mounts lost by
            European settlers, it is traditionally selected by the Nez-Perce
            Indians (Nimíipuu) established near the Palouse River. The great
            peculiarity of these horses is that they very often have a spotted
            coat, among other amazing physical characteristics. </td>
          <td style="width: 306.1px;">The Frisian (Dutch: Friese) is a breed of
            saddle and draft horse originating from Friesland, the province of
            the Netherlands from which it takes its name. He always wears a
            black dress, hence his nickname, "the black pearl". This very old
            prestige horse has had an eventful history, as a war mount and then
            a trotting racehorse, it was threatened with extinction due to the
            craze for the heavy draft horse at the end of the 19th century. </td>
          <td style="width: 306.1px;">The Shire (pronounced [ˈʃaɪə]) is a breed
            of British draft horses that originated in central England. He is
            nicknamed "gentle giant" thanks to his docility and his large size.
            The Shire holds the record for the tallest horse in the world. It is
            easily recognizable with its very abundant baleen and large white
            markings. Still used for agricultural work, it is mainly publicized
            by the brewing companies for which it pulls impressive cars.
            Exported to Europe, the United States, Canada and Australia, its
            workforce is relatively small but its popularity allows it to
            maintain itself. </td>

          western riding; elsewhere in the world, if a distinction is necessary,
          they are usually described as "classic riding": Hunt seat or Hunter
          classes judge the movement and the form of horses suitable for work

          fences as well as "Hunter under Saddle" or "flat" classes (sometimes
          called "hack" classes), in which the horse is judged on its
          performance, manners and movement without having to jump. . </b>

      <h1 id="westernriding" class="film"> <sup><u>2/Western riding</u></sup>:</h1>
      <p class="huh">Western riding is considered a style of horse riding which
        has evolved from the ranching and welfare traditions which were bought
        to the Americans by the Spanish Conquistadors, as well as both equipment
        and riding style which evolved to meet the working needs of the cowboy
        in the American West. At the time, American cowboys had to work long
        hours in the saddle and often over rough terrain, sometimes having to
        rope a cattle using a lariat, also known as a lasso.[1] Because of the
        necessity to control the horse with one hand and use a lariat with the
        other, western horses were trained to neck rein, that is, to change
        direction with light pressure of a rein against the horse's neck. Horses
        were also trained to exercise a certain degree of independence in using
        their natural instincts to follow the movements of a cow, thus a riding
        style developed that emphasized a deep, secure seat, and training
        methods encouraged a horse to be responsive on very light rein contact.
      </p>
      <p class="huh">Though there are significant differences in equipment,
        there are fewer differences between English and Western riding than
        appear at first glance. When comparing Western riding or English riding,
        the first, and biggest difference is the saddles used. </p>
